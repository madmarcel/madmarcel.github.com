My goal was to build a game that was NOT an RPG.</p><p>Note that this project is unfinished, there is currently no actual gameplay. It's just something to look at.</p><p>Things I would've liked to have implemented: Actual buying and selling of goods. Expanding the shop. Lazy employees. Managing shop inventory and prices. An in-game newspaper that affects product demand. Dealing with thugs that want to extort money from your shop. Etc.</p><p>All the code and assets are released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU GPL 3.0 license</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA 3.0 License</a><br/>That includes the LPC assets that I cleaned-up and re-coloured, and the additional art that I created for this game.</td><td><p>A screen resolution of 1280x800 pixels or more and a browser.</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> are preferred.</p><p>Seems to work OK in Internet Explorer 9.0 and Safari, but a little slower and jitterier.</p></td><td><a href="http://www.opengameart.org">OpenGameArt.org</a><br/><a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org">Liberated&nbsp;Pixel&nbsp;Cup</a><br/><br/><br/><a id="forkme_banner2" href="https://github.com/madmarcel/yoas">View YOAS on GitHub</a></td></tr>
				<tr><td><a href="yoas/newspaper/test.html">Random fantasy news paper generator</a><br/></td><td><img src="screenshots/newspaper.png"/></td><td><p>A page that generates random silly newspapers with a fantasy theme.</p><p>This was meant to be a part of the YOAS game. The idea was that at the end of each day you would quickly scan the headlines and look for items that might affect the next days purchases.<br/>E.g. "Goblins spotted near farm" implies there might be an upcoming demand for items that give bonuses versus goblins.</p></td><td><p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a> or Safari.</p><p>This uses a feature of CSS3 that is currently only implemented in Chrome and Safari. Won't display correctly in other browsers.</p></td><td></td></tr>
