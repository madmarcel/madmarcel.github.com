           <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
           <br/>
           <p><strong>Why did you make this?</strong></p>
           <p>I stumbled across the original blue ball machine GIF and the Github game off competition at approximately the same time.</p>
           <p><strong>But...it looks nothing like the original GIF!</strong></p>
           <p>That GIF is probably copyrighted. Who knows. Better be safe than sorry.</p>
           <p><strong>How does this incorporate the competitions theme of 'change'?</strong></p>
           <p>All the other blue ball machines I found are static. You can change this one as you please. It's ever changing and never the same.</p>
           <p><strong>BLUE Ball Machine? Why can I change the colour of the balls?</strong></p>
           <p>Uhhh...the competitions theme was 'change', uh yeah, that's why.</p>           
           <br/>
           <p><strong>Why does the winning sound effect only play once?</strong></p>
           <p>I coded it that way. Trust me, it's better that way.</p>
           <p><strong>The balls get stuck on some of the widgets.</strong></p>
           <p>It's a bug. I'll fix it when I get around to it.</p>                      
           <p><strong>How come I can solve the game by just placing widgets? What is the point of the balls then?</strong></p>
           <p>Waiting for a ball to traverse all the widgets would take a very long time.</p>
           <br/>
           <p><strong>There are not enough widgets. MOAR WIDGETS!</strong></p>
           <p>This game is open source. Feel free to make some more.</p>
           <p><strong>Is there a widget editor?</strong></p>
           <p>I started on one, but ran out of time. Maybe another day.</p>
