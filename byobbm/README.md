## BYO BBM - Build Your Own Blue Ball Machine

My entry for the GitHub Game Off 2013.

This is an HTML5 based game, no plugins required.


The premise is simple:

Build a blue ball machine as such that a ball can visit each widget on the page at least once.

Art and open source libraries used are listed in the credits page.
